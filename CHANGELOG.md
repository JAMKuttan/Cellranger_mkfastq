**Background**

*Known Bugs*
* cellranger mkfastq will not accept spaces in path for run param even if quoted, issue raised on 10XGenomics/cellranger github issue [#31](https://github.com/10XGenomics/cellranger/issues/31)
    * note: 10x doesn't check github issues, emailed instead
    * note: pipeline checks for spaces and exits prematurely if found
* If multiple flowcells (tar'd) files are inputted then there will be multiple fastq's by the same name, currently dealing with that name conflict is not tractable
